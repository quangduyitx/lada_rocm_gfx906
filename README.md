*Lada* is a tool designed to recover pixelated adult videos (JAV). It helps restore the visual quality of such content, making it more enjoyable to watch.

## Features

- **Recover Pixelated Videos**: Restore pixelated or mosaic scenes in adult videos.
- **Watch/Export Videos**: Use either the CLI or GUI to watch or export your restored videos.

## Usage

### GUI

After opening a file, you can either watch the restored video in real time or export it to a new file to watch it later:

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/screenshot_gui_1_dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/screenshot_gui_1_light.png">
  <img alt="Screenshot showing video preview" src="assets/screenshot_gui_1_dark.png" width="36%">
</picture>
<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/screenshot_gui_2_dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/screenshot_gui_2_light.png">
  <img alt="Screenshot showing video export" src="assets/screenshot_gui_2_dark.png" width="45%">
</picture>

Additional settings can be found in the left sidebar.

### CLI

You can also use the command-line interface (CLI) to restore video(s):

```shell
lada-cli --input <input video path>
```
<img src="assets/screenshot_cli_1.png" alt="screenshot showing video export" width="60%">

For more information about additional options, use the `--help` argument.

## Performance expectations and hardware requirements
The restoration quality can vary depending on the scene. Some may look quite realistic, while others could display noticeable artifacts, sometimes worse than the original mosaics.

To run the app effectively, you'll need a GPU and some patience. A graphics card with at least 4-6GB of VRAM should work well for most cases.

The app also requires a fair amount of RAM for buffering, which improves performance. For 1080p content, 6-8GB of RAM should suffice, but 4K video will require significantly more.

To watch the restored video in real-time, you'll need a powerful machine. Otherwise, the player may pause and buffer as it computes the next set of restored frames. While viewing the video, no encoding is done, but additional RAM will be used for buffering.

If your GPU isn't fast enough for real-time playback, you can export the video and watch it later in your preferred media player (this is supported in both the GUI and CLI).

Although the app can run on a CPU, performance will be extremely slow, making it impractical for most users.

## Installation
### Using Flatpak
The easiest way to install the app (CLI and GUI) on Linux is via Flathub:

<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.ladaapp.lada'><img width='200' alt='Download from Flathub' src='https://flathub.org/api/badge?svg&locale=en'/></a>

> [!NOTE]
> The Flatpak only works with x86_64 CPUs. Nvidia/CUDA (Turing or newer: RTX 20xx up to including RTX 50xx) and Intel Arc GPUs are supported. Ensure your GPU driver is up-to-date.
> It can also be used without a GPU but it will be very slow. Make sure to install either the Intel or the Nvidia Add-On from Flathub.

> [!TIP]
> After installation you should find Lada in your application launcher to start the GUI. You can also run it via `flatpak run io.github.ladaapp.lada`.

> [!TIP]
> When using the CLI via Flatpak we need to make the file/directory available by giving it permission to the file system so it can access the input/output files
>  ```shell
>  flatpak run --filesystem=host --command=lada-cli io.github.ladaapp.lada --input <input video path>
>  ```
> You may want to set an alias to make it easier to use
> ```shell
> alias lada-cli="flatpak run --filesystem=host --command=lada-cli io.github.ladaapp.lada"
>  ```
> You could also give the filesystem permission permanently via [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal) 

> [!TIP]
> If you want to use the Post-export action feature to run a command/script after export has finished you'll need to give the Flatpak additional permissions.
> Add the `--talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak` permission and then run your command via `flatpak-spawn`. For example: If the script you want to run is /home/user/myscript.sh then set custom command as `flatpak-spawn --host /home/user/myscript.sh`

> [!TIP]
> If you installed Lada from Flathub and drag-and-drop doesn't work, your file browser might not support [File Transfer Portal](https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/doc-org.freedesktop.portal.FileTransfer.html).
> You can fix this by:
>  1) Switching or updating your file browser to one that supports it.
>  2) Granting the app filesystem permissions (e.g., via [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal) so it can read files directly).
>  3)  Using the 'Open' button to select the file instead of drag-and-drop.

### Using Docker

The app is also available via Docker (CLI only). You can get the image `ladaapp/lada` from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ladaapp/lada) with this command:

```shell
docker pull ladaapp/lada:latest
````

> [!NOTE]
> The Docker image only works with x86_64 CPUs and Nvidia/CUDA GPUs (Turing or newer: RTX 20xx up to including RTX 50xx). Ensure your NVIDIA GPU driver is up-to-date.
> It can also be used without a GPU but it will be very slow.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure that you have installed the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) on your system so Docker can pass through the GPU

> [!TIP]
> When using Docker you'll need to make the file/directory available to the container as well as the GPU:
>  ```shell
> docker run --rm --gpus all --mount type=bind,src=<input video path>,dst=/mnt ladaapp/lada:latest --input "/mnt/<input video file>"
> ```

> [!TIP]
> If you want to use hardware encoders like `hevc_nvenc` you have to provide the container with `video` capability.
> 
> With docker run you can use `--gpus 'all,"capabilities=compute,video"'`. Learn more [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/docker-specialized.html).

### Using Windows

For Windows users, the app (CLI and GUI) is packaged as a standalone .7z archive file.
You'll need [7-zip](https://7-zip.org/) to unpack the files. It is recommended to validate the file after downloading. See the Tip below.

Get the latest release from the [Releases Page](https://codeberg.org/ladaapp/lada/releases).

You'll find `lada.exe` and `lada-cli.exe` after extracting the archive.

> [!NOTE]
> The Windows release only works with x86_64 CPUs. Nvidia/CUDA (Turing or newer: RTX 20xx up to including RTX 50xx) and Intel Arc GPUs are supported. Ensure your GPU driver is up-to-date.
> It can also be used without a GPU but it will be very slow.

> [!NOTE]
> Be aware that the first start of lada.exe or lada-cli.exe could take a while before Windows Defender or your AV has scanned it. The next time you open the program it should start fast.

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended to compare the checksum of the downloaded file against the value you'll find in the release announcement.
> This makes sure that you got the correct and unaltered file, especially important if you got the file from an unofficial source.
> 
> Calculate the checksum of the downloaded file on your computer and compare it against the `SHA256` value you'll find in the release announcement. They must be the same!
> 
> You can do this with Powershell `Get-FileHash /path/to/file.7z` or [QuickHash-GUI](https://www.quickhash-gui.org/).

### Alternative Installation Methods

If the packages above don't work for you then you'll have to follow the [Build](#build) steps to set up the project.

Note that these instructions are mostly intended for developers to set up their environment to start working on the source code. But you should hopefully be able
to follow the instructions even if you aren't a developer.

Officially, Lada supports only Nvidia and Intel Arc GPUs but there have been reports that AMD ROCm-compatible cards and Apple work as well.
